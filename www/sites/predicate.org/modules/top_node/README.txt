Top Node lets lets you set up page views that display a single node, complete
with comments, edit/view/revisions tabs, and so on. It's useful for building
urls like www.example.com/latest-comic or www.example.com/random-node, which are
fully bookmarkable and permissioned but display exactly what would appear on the
node module's default node/1 style page.

Build a node view, and choose 'Node page' as the display style - everything else
will be handled automatically.
